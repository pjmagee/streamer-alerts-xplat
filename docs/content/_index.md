## Why Streamer Alerts?

Other tools either spam, miss streams, or only support one platform. Streamer Alerts XPlat gives you **reliable, low-noise alerts** across multiple services in a single place.

### What You Get

| Benefit | What It Means For You |
|---------|-----------------------|
| Multi‑platform | Track Twitch, YouTube & Kick from one app (more coming) |
| High accuracy | Hardened detection logic reduces false "LIVE" states |
| Fast detection | Smart scheduling keeps checks quick without hammering sites |
| Lightweight | Small footprint – runs quietly in the background |
| Auto updates | You always stay on the latest features & fixes |
| Privacy friendly | No account required for basic monitoring (scrape mode) |

### Core Features

- Unified live status panel
- Instant tray / system notifications
- Optional always-on channels (24/7 streams handled gracefully)
- Works even when official APIs rate limit or delay
- Automatic background updates

### Quick Start (End Users)

1. Download the installer for your OS from the Releases page.
2. Install & launch the app.
3. Add the streamers you want to follow.
4. Leave it running – you’ll get a notification the moment they go live.

### Power & Accuracy Under the Hood

The app uses real headless Chrome to read what a human viewer would see. That means fewer false positives than tools relying only on APIs or stale page fragments.

### Roadmap (Planned)

- Discord / Webhook notification targets
- Custom sound & notification settings
- Grouping / categories for streamer lists
- Export / import streamer sets

### Having Issues?

Check for updates (they install automatically), then open an issue with:

1. Platform (Windows / macOS / Linux)
2. Streamer that failed
3. Expected vs shown status

### Auto Updates

The app updates itself silently in the background. See the detailed [Auto Update Guide](/auto-update/).
