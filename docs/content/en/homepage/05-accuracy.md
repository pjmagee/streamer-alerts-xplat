The app offers both custom Twitch, Kick, YouTube API integration for advanced usage, but the default Puppeteer browser option is the default and uses a real browser to check if streamers are live. This avoids API calls but can sometimes produce false positives. Be sure to raise an issue if you notice unwanted notifications.
