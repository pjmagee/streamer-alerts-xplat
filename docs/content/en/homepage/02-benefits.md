| Benefit | What It Means For You |
|---------|-----------------------|
| Multi‑platform | Track Twitch, YouTube & Kick from one app |
| Fast detection | Smart scheduling keeps checks quick without hammering sites |
| Lightweight | Small footprint – runs quietly in the background on a headless browser |
| Auto updates | You always stay on the latest features & fixes |
| Privacy friendly | No account required for basic monitoring (scrape mode) |
| API Strategy | Stronger accuracy but with limited API usage is an option |

The browser option is the default and recommended as it requires no account creation, no API creation and no developer app creation for API Keys which is an advanced and more complicated method.
