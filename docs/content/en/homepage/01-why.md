Streamer Alerts XPlat enables you to get alerts on streamers across the three major streaming platforms, without needing to configure alerts in multiple locations. You don't need to configure notifications for emails, or in-browser notifications or check if your phone is around. The desktop app will bring up a popup notification which you can click to instantly open the stream on that platform.
