# Assets Directory

This directory contains icons and images for the Streamer Alerts application.

## Icon Requirements

For a production app, you would need:

- tray-icon.png (16x16 or 32x32 for system tray)
- app-icon.png (larger icon for the application window)
- notification-icon.png (icon for notifications)

## Icon Formats

- **Windows**: .ico files are recommended
- **macOS**: .icns files are recommended  
- **Linux**: .png files work well

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using any image editor. For a simple streaming app, consider:

- Red circle with play button for live indicator
- Webcam or broadcast tower symbol
- Simple geometric shapes in brand colors

For now, the app will use fallback system icons if these files are not present.
